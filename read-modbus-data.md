**How to Read Modbus Data**
===========================

Today we are going to discuss using **[Modbus Analyzer](https://www.eltima.com/products/modbus-analyzer/)** to read and capture Modbus data. This advanced software application is the perfect choice for system admins and developers who handle Modbus networks and devices. If you already have a Modbus network in place or are considering employing the Modbus protocol in your local network, this overview will prove to be very helpful.

This Modbus reader software is designed to be used by anyone working with equipment or software that communicates via the Modbus protocol. Software and hardware developers and testers will find the application to be an indispensable part of their software toolbox. The Modbus RTU reader lets you intercept and analyze the flow of data transmitted between your devices through serial ports. 

Using this Modbus reader app, you can monitor two-way [communication of serial devices communicating within a Modbus network](https://www.eltima.com/article/modbus-tester-guide/). The RS232, RS422, and RS485 protocols for serial interfaces are fully supported.

Follow these steps to read and log Modbus data on your network using this comprehensive serial communication application.
