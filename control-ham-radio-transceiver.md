**Some of the common issues encountered by Ham radio operators and the best ways to resolve them.**
===================================================================================================

1. You can run into a bottleneck when two essential applications try to communicate with the transceiver through the same COM port. One frequent situation where this becomes an issue is if you are using logging software as a station log book while also using your computer’s station control software. At first glance, it does not seem possible to create a simultaneous connection so you need to use a workaround. This involves shutting down one application in order to use the other one. While this is a common way to connect two applications to the same port, it is not a very efficient solution.

When using multiple applications that require access to the same COM interface, using specialized COM port splitter software offers a clean and effective method of sharing the port simultaneously. An excellent choice when looking for serial port splitter software is **[Virtual Serial Port Driver PRO](https://www.eltima.com/products/vspdxp/#vspd-versions)**. Use of COM port splitter software enables you to create several virtual serial ports from one physical port, allowing multiple serial applications to use the same physical port at any time. You connect to virtual copies of the interface, but in fact, are using the same real port. Now your transceiver’s serial port can be shared among as many different applications as you desire.

Virtual Serial Port Driver PRO offers full support of both 32 bit and 64 bit operating systems. It works with Windows 10 as well as many older versions of the Windows OS.


2. Another scenario where Virtual Serial Port Driver PRO will prove to be useful is if you are using a logging program to control your radio and also have CW Skimmer, MixW, or another application also connected to the same control. Your best solution here is to use serial splitter software.

**[Serial Port Logger](https://www.eltima.com/products/rs232-data-logger/)** by Eltima can be used as data logging software. Using this application will enable you to trace, debug, and monitor any of your system’s serial ports and display captured data in a user-friendly manner.


3. Another challenging situation is when a GPS user has multiple applications attempting to share a single NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) information stream. Serial port splitters need to be employed to create several data streams from the original single stream. A simple solution is to use Virtual Serial Port Driver PRO to create an unlimited number of virtual copies of the data traveling through a GPS port. Now you can route the navigation signal sent from a single NMEA port to the virtual ports of various serial applications simultaneously and all programs will receive the same data.


**Virtual Serial Port Driver PRO** is one of the best and most useful serial port splitters currently on the market.
