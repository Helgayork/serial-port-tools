**How to log and analyze RS232 data acquisition?**
==================================================

**What is Data Acquisition?**
-----------------------------

Data acquisition is a process involving the monitoring and measuring of physical conditions such as sound, pressure, temperature, and electricity. Analog-to-digital converters are used to create the digital equivalent of the original analog signals. The digital representations can then be used by computers for storage, data analysis, and visual as well as aural presentations.

The foundation of data acquisition is built on multiple kinds of physical sensors. Electrical signals are sent from the sensors to data acquisition instruments that digitizes the signals. They are then sent to be analyzed and manipulated by a PC running specialized software tools.

You may not have noticed, but data acquisition and analysis fill crucial roles in fields as diverse as scientific research, industrial control systems, and civil engineering, to name only a few. Most public utility buildings, factories, and research centers have multiple data acquisition devices on premises. The devices monitor parameters in the background and collect data for future analysis. This analysis can point to safety improvements as well as ways to enhance your enterpriseâ€™s levels of efficiency and reliability.
